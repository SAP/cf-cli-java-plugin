# Cloud Foundry Command Line Java plugin

This plugin for the [Cloud Foundry Command Line](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli) provides convenience utilities to work with Java applications deployed on Cloud Foundry.

Currently, it allows to:
* Trigger and retrieve a heap dump from an instance of a Cloud Foundry Java application
* Trigger and retrieve a thread dump from an instance of a Cloud Foundry Java application

## Installation

### Installation via CF Community Repository

Make sure you have the CF Community plugin repository configured or add it via (```cf add-plugin-repo CF-Community http://plugins.cloudfoundry.org```)

Trigger installation of the plugin via
```
cf install-plugin -r CF-Community "java"
```

### Manual Installation
Download the binary file for your target OS from the [latest release](https://github.com/SAP/cf-cli-java-plugin/releases/latest).

If you've already installed the plugin and are updating it, you must first execute the `cf uninstall-plugin java` command.

Install the plugin with `cf install-plugin [cf-cli-java-plugin]` (replace `[cf-cli-java-plugin]` with the actual binary name you will use, which depends on the OS you are running).

You can verify that the plugin is successfully installed by looking for `java` in the output of `cf plugins`.

### Updating from version 1.x to 2.x

With release 2.0 we aligned the convention of the plugin having the same name as the command it contributes (in our case, `java`).
This change mostly affects you in the way you update your plugin.
If you have the version 1.x installed, you will need to uninstall the old version first by using the command: `cf uninstall-plugin JavaPlugin`.
You know you have the version 1.x installed if `JavaPlugin` appears in the output of `cf plugins`.

### Permission Issues

On Linux and macOS, if you get a permission error, run `chmod +x [cf-cli-java-plugin]` (replace `[cf-cli-java-plugin]` with the actual binary name you will use, which depends on the OS you are running) on the plugin binary.
On Windows, the plugin will refuse to install unless the binary has the `.exe` file extension.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

#### JDK Tools
This plugin internally uses `jmap` for OpenJDK-like Java virtual machines. When using the [Cloud Foundry Java Buildpack](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack), `jmap` is no longer shipped by default in order to meet the legal obligations of the Cloud Foundry Foundation.
To ensure that `jmap` is available in the container of your application, you have to explicitly request a full JDK in your application manifest via the `JBP_CONFIG_OPEN_JDK_JRE` environment variable. This could be done like this:

```yaml
---
applications:
- name: <APP_NAME>
  memory: 1G
  path: <PATH_TO_BUILD_ARTIFACT>
  buildpack: https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack
  env:
    JBP_CONFIG_OPEN_JDK_JRE: '{ jre: { repository_root: "https://java-buildpack.cloudfoundry.org/openjdk-jdk/bionic/x86_64", version: 11.+ } }'
```
Please note that this requires the use of an online buildpack (configured in the `buildpack` property). When system buildpacks are used, staging will fail with cache issues, because the system buildpacks donâ€™t have the JDK chached.
Please also note that this is not to be considered a recommendation to use a full JDK. It's just one option to get the tools required for the use of this plugin when you need it, e.g., for troubleshooting.
The `version` property is optional and can be used to request a specific Java version.

#### SSH Access
As it is built directly on `cf ssh`, the `cf java` plugin can work only with Cloud Foundry applications that have `cf ssh` enabled.
To check if your app fulfills the requirements, you can find out by running the `cf ssh-enabled [app-name]` command.
If not enabled yet, run `cf enable-ssh [app-name]`.

**Note:** You must restart your app after enabling SSH access.

In case a proxy server is used, ensure that `cf ssh` is configured accordingly.
Refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/http-proxy.html#v3-ssh-socks5) of the Cloud Foundry Command Line for more information.
If `cf java` is having issues connecting to your app, chances are the problem is in the networking issues encountered by `cf ssh`.
To verify, run your `cf java` command in "dry-run" mode by adding the `-n` flag and try to execute the command line that `cf java` gives you back.
If it fails, the issue is not in `cf java`, but in whatever makes `cf ssh` fail.

### Commands
<pre>
NAME:
   java - Obtain a heap dump or thread dump from a running, SSH-enabled Java application

USAGE:
   cf java [heap-dump|thread-dump] APP_NAME

OPTIONS:
   -app-instance-index       -i [index], select to which instance of the app to connect
   -dry-run                  -n, just output to command line what would be executed
   -keep                     -k, keep the heap dump in the container; by default the heap dump will be deleted from the container's filesystem after been downloaded
   -container-dir            -cd, the directory path in the container that the heap dump file will be saved to
   -local-dir                -ld, the local directory path that the dump file will be saved to
</pre>

The heap dump will be copied if `-local-dir` is specified (should be full folder path):

```shell
cf java heap-dump [my-app] --container-dir /var/fspath --local-dir /local/path
```

The thread dump will be outputted to `std-out`.
You may want to redirect the command's output to file, e.g., by executing:

```shell
cf java thread-dump [my_app] -i [my_instance_index] > heap-dump.hprof
```

The `-k` flag is invalid when invoking `cf java thread-dump`.
(Unlike with heap dumps, the JVM does not need to output the thread dump to file before streaming it out.)

## Limitations

The capability of creating heap dumps is also limited by the filesystem available to the container.
The `cf java heap-dump` command triggers the heap dump to file system, read the content of the file over the SSH connection, and then remove the heap dump file from the container's file system (unless you have the `-k` flag set).
The amount of filesystem space available to a container is set for the entire Cloud Foundry landscape with a global configuration.
The size of a heap dump is roughly linear with the allocated memory of the heap.
So, it could be that, in case of large heaps or the filesystem having too much stuff in it, there is not enough space on the filesystem for creating the heap dump.
In that case, the creation of the heap dump and thus the command will fail.

From the perspective of integration in workflows and overall shell-friendliness, the `cf java` plugin suffers from some shortcomings in the current `cf-cli` plugin framework:
* There is no distinction between `stdout` and `stderr` output from the underlying `cf ssh` command (see [this issue on the `cf-cli` project](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/issues/1074))
  * The `cf java` will however exit with status code `1` when the underpinning `cf ssh` command fails
  * If split between `stdout` and `stderr` is needed, you can run the `cf java` plugin in dry-run mode (`--dry-run` flag) and execute its output instead
* The plugin is not current capability of storing output directly to file (see [this issue on the `cf-cli` project](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/issues/1069))
  * The upstream change needed to fix this issue has been scheduled at Pivotal; when they provide the new API we need, we'll update the `cf java` command to save output to file.

## Side-effects on the running instance

Executing a thread dump via the `cf java` command does not have much of an overhead on the affected JVM.
(Unless you have **a lot** of threads, that is.)

Heap dumps, on the other hand, have to be treated with a little more care.
First of all, triggering the heap dump of a JVM makes the latter execute in most cases a full garbage collection, which will cause your JVM to become unresponsive for the duration.
How much time is needed to execute the heap dump, depends on the size of the heap (the bigger, the slower), the algorithm used and, above all, whether your container is swapping memory to disk or not (swap is *bad* for the JVM).
Since Cloud Foundry allows for over-commit in its cells, it is possible that a container would begin swapping when executing a full garbage collection.
(To be fair, it could be swapping even *before* the garbage collection begins, but let's not knit-pick here.)
So, it is theoretically possible that execuing a heap dump on a JVM in poor status of health will make it go even worse.

Secondly, as the JVMs output heap dumps to the filesystem, creating a heap dump may lead to to not enough space on the filesystem been available for other tasks (e.g., temp files).
In that case, the application in the container may suffer unexpected errors.

## Tests and Mocking

The tests are written using [Ginkgo](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/) with [Gomega](https://onsi.github.io/gomega/) for the BDD structure, and [Counterfeiter](https://github.com/maxbrunsfeld/counterfeiter) for the mocking generation.
Unless modifications to the helper interfaces `cmd.CommandExecutor` and `uuid.UUIDGenerator` are needed, there should be no need to regenerate the mocks.

To run the tests, go to the root of the repository and simply run `gingko` (you may need to install Ginkgo first, e.g., `go get github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo` puts the executable under `$GOPATH/bin`).
